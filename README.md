# Leukemia Cancer Risk Prediction

## Overview
This project explores the impact of demographic and socioeconomic biases on leukemia risk prediction. The goal is to identify and mitigate any biases present in the dataset and improve the fairness and accuracy of the predictive model.

## Project Structure
- `biased_leukemia_dataset.csv`: The dataset containing demographic, socioeconomic, and medical information.
- `leukemia.ipynb`: Jupyter notebook containing the data analysis, bias detection, and model training process.
- `model.pth`: The trained model file.
- `README.md`: Project documentation.

## Getting Started
### Prerequisites
- Python 3.x
- Jupyter Notebook
- PyTorch
- Pandas
- Scikit-learn

### Installation
1. Clone the repository:
    ```sh
    git clone https://github.com/Amoako419/Leukemia_Cancer_Risk_Prediction.git
    ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
    ```sh
    cd Leukemia_Cancer_Risk_Prediction
    ```


### Usage
1. Open the Jupyter notebook:
    ```sh
    jupyter notebook leukemia.ipynb
    ```
2. Follow the steps in the notebook to analyze the data, detect biases, and train the model.

## Results
The results of the analysis and the trained model are saved in the [model.pth](http://_vscodecontentref_/1) file. The notebook provides detailed explanations and visualizations of the findings.
